## Summary

Use the **Built-in plugins** settings section to inspect plugins when another plugin contributes a tab. The section is a shell: it owns the navigation entry and the tab row, and every tab in it is registered by another plugin. Configuring a built-in plugin happens on the sidebar's Plugins page, where each official plugin's own companion package registers its page.

## Use this package

Open **Built-in plugins** in Settings. Each registered tab appears in the section; a lone tab is shown as the page itself, and multiple tabs appear in a tab row. A deployment whose composition contributes no tab shows the section's empty line.

To contribute a tab, register into `settings.plugins.tab` with an `id`, an `order`, and a localized `label`; the section renders the entries in order and mounts a tab on its first selection. Feature copy stays in the registering plugin's dictionary.

## Understand the implementation

The section declares `settings.plugins.tab`, a root list slot whose labels become ordered tabs; a lone contribution renders as the page itself, and a tab stays mounted after its first selection so search and the inventory snapshot survive switching. The section's `inject` projects the slot's ledger into ordered rows whose labels follow the active locale, cached until the ledger version or the locale revision moves. The Host half is an empty `apply`, present only so the package holds a Loader row the client module system serves the browser half for.

## Further Exploration

- [ui-settings-plugin-inventory](../ui-settings-plugin-inventory/README.md) — an optional read-only inventory tab.
- [ui-settings](../ui-settings/README.md) — the domain base declaring `settings.section`.
- [ui-plugin-manager](../ui-plugin-manager/README.md) — the Plugins page where official plugins are configured.
- [ui-settings-shell](../ui-settings-shell/README.md), [ui-settings-agent-loop](../ui-settings-agent-loop/README.md), [ui-settings-subagent](../ui-settings-subagent/README.md), [ui-settings-web-search](../ui-settings-web-search/README.md) — the official configuration pages, one companion package each.

## Model Experience

None, as the package is a browser-side settings surface that registers no model surface.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The section has no tab of its own** — it renders its empty line until a feature plugin registers one; the shell cannot fill the section alone.
